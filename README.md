# ExtraHighliters
This came bundled as part of luamacros (https://github.com/me2d13/luamacros.git) in the form of an archive. I could not locate the original repository online for the source contained in the ExtraHighliters.7z archive (https://github.com/me2d13/luamacros/blob/master/lib/ExtraHighlighters.7z) so I decided to create my own repository so that I could fix the issues that prevented it from compiling. Maybe it is of some use to someone other than myself.
